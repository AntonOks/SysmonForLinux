# syscalls.rules
# each line starts with the syscall number to log
# followed by space-separated clauses
# each clause can be an argument (a0 .. a5), an operator (=, <, >, &, |)
# and a value (leading 0 for octal, 0x for hex)
# OR can be the global P or V. P indicates all events generated for this
# syscall number must correctly parse standard fields, and V indicates that
# all events for this syscall number must correctly parse any syscall-specific
# fields.
# Operator & ANDs the argument and the value and checks the result equals
# the value (&= in auditctl); and operator | ANDs the argument with the value
# and checks the result is not 0 (& in auditctl).
